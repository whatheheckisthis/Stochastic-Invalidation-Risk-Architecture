### 1.0 Executive Summary — Assurance Architecture

**SIRA (Stochastic-Invalidation-Risk-Architecture) and IĀTŌ-MCP (Intent-Auditable-Trust-Object) form a dual-layer Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) assurance architecture**. 

- Designed to separate model risk production from execution control enforcement. The architecture establishes a clear segregation of duties between quantitative risk generation and deterministic orchestration governance, ensuring alignment with model risk management, regulatory auditability, and controlled system execution standards.

- This structure is designed to satisfy core GRC assurance expectations across model risk governance, operational resilience, and regulatory traceability, ensuring that all outputs are both **mathematically defensible and operationally auditable**.

### 7.0 Methodology (GRC Assurance Framework)

### 7.1 **System Initialization & Control Environment**

This system operates as a **financial engineering control environment**, where all execution is gated by pre-run validation, governed configuration, and enforced data lineage constraints.

| Stage                                       | Control Objective                                      | Control Design                                                                                                                                                         | Assurance Condition                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Preflight Validation** (`00_env_check.R`) | Ensure runtime integrity before analytical execution | Environment version checks (R, dependencies); configuration parse validation; output writability checks; data manifest integrity verification; SHA-256 hash validation | Execution is terminated on any control failure (hard stop, non-zero exit) |
| **Configuration Control** (`00_config.R`)   | Establish single governed parameter source             | Loads `config/sira.toml` into structured runtime object (`CFG`)                                                                                                        | No analytical execution permitted without validated configuration state   |
| **Data Lineage Control** (`01_load_data.R`) | Enforce data provenance and mode separation            | Enforces `live` vs `synthetic` segregation via manifest governance                                                                                                     | Any lineage mismatch results in execution halt                            |

**GRC Principle:**
No computation is permitted outside a validated control environment.

---

### 7.2 **Stress & Risk Modelling**

| Loss Estimation                     | Quantify downside exposure                            | LGD transformation: (1 - recovery)                                              | LGD distribution            |

**GRC Constraint:**
Outputs are descriptive risk signals only and do not constitute discretionary decision authority.

---

### 7.3 **Capital Stack & Solvency Control Framework**

This layer models **financial resilience under stress**, assessing solvency capacity relative to contractual obligations.

| Component                                    | Control Objective                        | Financial Engineering Function               | Output                   |

| Capital Reporting (`13_capital_stack_viz.R`) | Provide structured capital visibility    | Aggregated capital state representation      | Capital stack outputs    |

### 7.3.1 **Capital Flow Control Model**

| Metric          | Control Expression                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Gross Income    | deployed capital × yield + fees      |
| Net Income      | gross income − LGD stress impact     |
| Spread Position | net income − contractual obligations |

**Governance Constraint:**
Solvency classification is adjusted post-derivatives hedging effect before the final state emission.

---

| Committee Synthesis (`25_deal_summary.R`) | Consolidated decision reporting        | Risk-weighted summary output      |

---

### 7.5 **Derivatives & Options Risk Engine**

This layer implements **risk-neutral financial engineering models** for derivative valuation and hedge behaviour under stress scenarios.

| Component                                | Control Objective                         | Output                     |

---

### 7.5.1 Options Intelligence Layer (`scripts/30–36`)

*Grounded in Haugh (2016), Columbia IEOR E4706.*

**BSM derivation basis**

Stock price follows geometric Brownian motion:
```
dSt = µSt dt + σSt dWt
```

Under risk-neutral measure Q (drift µ eliminated):
```
dSt = rSt dt + σSt dWtQ
```

Black-Scholes PDE:
```
rS(∂C/∂S) + (∂C/∂t) + (½)σ²S²(∂²C/∂S²) − rC = 0
```

Closed-form solution with continuous dividend yield q:
```
d1 = (log(S/K) + (r − q + σ²/2)(T−t)) / (σ√(T−t))
d2 = d1 − σ√(T−t)
C  = exp(−q(T−t)) × S × Φ(d1) − exp(−r(T−t)) × K × Φ(d2)
P  = C − exp(−qT) × S + exp(−rT) × K   [put-call parity]
```

The elimination of µ from the PDE is a governance feature in
SIRA's context: firm value drift is unobservable and
scenario-dependent. Risk-neutral pricing removes it by construction.

**Greeks (Haugh Section 3)**
```
Δ_call = exp(−qT) × Φ(d1)
Δ_put  = Δ_call − exp(−qT)
Γ      = exp(−qT) × φ(d1) / (S × σ × √T)
ν      = exp(−qT) × S × √T × φ(d1)
θ_call = −(exp(−qT) × S × φ(d1) × σ)/(2√T)
         + q × exp(−qT) × S × Φ(d1)
         − r × K × exp(−rT) × Φ(d2)
ρ_call = K × T × exp(−rT) × Φ(d2)
```

P&L attribution per scenario (Taylor approximation):
```
P&L ≈ Δ×ΔS + (Γ/2)×ΔS² + ν×Δσ
```

**Instrument mapping**

| Instrument | Option type | Underlying | Strike |
|---|---|---|---|
| Distressed bond recovery | Put on firm value | Firm asset value V | Debt face value D |
| Equity kicker | Call on company equity | Equity value at entry | Warrant strike K |
| Indexed annuity floor | Put on portfolio return | Net portfolio yield | Floor rate |

**Leverage effect (Merton/Haugh)**

As stressed recovery declines, firm equity vol rises:
```
σ_equity ≈ (V/E) × σ_firm
```

This creates a documented stress amplification mechanism:
lower recovery → higher implied vol → higher put price →
larger solvency headroom erosion. Named and governed in
`RISK_COMMITTEE.md`

**Volatility surface**

Scenario-governed, not market-calibrated. Skew implemented
via parameterised adjustment:
```
σ(K) = σ_base + skew_factor × (ATM_K − K) / ATM_K
```

Arbitrage constraints enforced per Haugh Section 2:
butterfly and calendar spread checks emitted to the preflight log.

**Delta-hedge replication error (Haugh eq. 24)**
```
P&L = Σ (St²/2 × Γt × (σ²_implied − σ²_scenario) × Δt)
```

Positive P&L → scenario vol below implied → hedge gain.
Negative P&L → scenario vol above implied → solvency erosion.
Signal: `HEDGE_GAIN` / `HEDGE_NEUTRAL` / `HEDGE_LOSS` per scenario.

### 7.6 **System Orchestration & Execution Governance**

This layer enforces **deterministic execution sequencing and failure containment**.

| Stage                             | Control Function                   | Assurance Property                      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Pipeline Controller (`run_all.R`) | Sequential execution orchestration | Deterministic execution order           |
| Monitoring Layer                  | Runtime observability              | Execution traceability                  |
| Failure Handling                  | Hard-stop enforcement              | No partial or degraded states permitted |

### 7.6.1 **Execution Constraint**

### 7.6.2 Orchestration (`run_all.R`)

Full pipeline execution order:
```
00_env_check → 00_config → 01_load_data → 02_analysis →
03_visualize → 10_liability_engine → 11_credit_deployment →
12_spread_stress → 13_capital_stack_viz → 20_dcf → 21_ma →
22_accretion → 23_lbo → 24_irr → 25_deal_summary →
30_bs_core → 30b_greeks → 34_vol_surface → 31_recovery_put →
32_kicker_call → 33_annuity_floor → 36_delta_hedge →
35_options_summary → 25_deal_summary [final pass]
```

Terminal harness emits header, per-stage progress, wall-clock time
elapsed, and exit status. Mid-pipeline failures halt with
labelled error output — no silent partial runs.

**Control Rule:**
All execution is atomic; partial completion states are invalid.

---

## 8.0 **Scenario Governance Framework**

Scenarios define **controlled stress environments for financial engineering simulation**.

| Scenario | Stress mechanism | Distribution | Vol multiplier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline | Normal market functioning | Beta | `1.00×` |
| Liquidity Crunch | Elevated vol, compressed recoveries | Beta | `shock_multiplier` |
| Jurisdictional Freeze | Recovery collapses toward ruin threshold | Beta | `shock_multiplier` |
| Counterparty Default | Gap-down valuation shock | Power Law | exponent-implied |
| Hyper-Inflationary | FX devaluation impairs real bond value | Power Law | `fx_devaluation` |

All scenario parameters — shape, exponent, ruin threshold, shock
multiplier, FX devaluation, vol multiplier — are declared in
`config/sira.toml`. No scenario definition exists outside the TOML.

---

### 8.1 **Scenario Control**

| Rule                   | Governance Requirement                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Single Source of Truth | All scenario definitions reside in `config/sira.toml`  |
| No Hardcoding          | Scenario logic is externalised from analytical scripts |
| Version Control        | Scenario parameters are immutable per execution run    |

---

### 9.0 **Global GRC Assurance**

This system operates as a **bounded financial engineering simulation and risk analytics environment** under strict governance constraints.

| Dimension              | Control Statement                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authority              | No module constitutes decision authority                               |
| Scope                  | Execution is strictly bounded by configuration and manifest controls   |
| Interpretive Power     | No analytical output is independently authoritative                    |
| Output Nature          | Advisory, diagnostic, and computational only                           |
| Governance Requirement | All outputs must be interpreted within the governing framework context |

| `data/manifest/data_manifest.toml` | Controlled input registry with SHA-256, lineage references, and approval fields |

## 12.0 Quickstart — MCP Orchestration Server

> The MCP server exposes enumerated actions only. Claude Code cannot infer
> configuration from context, execute arbitrary shell commands, or register
> actions at runtime. It applies the version-controlled script or stops.

---

### 12.1 Requirements

### 12.1.1 MCP server runtime

These dependencies must be present before `npm install.`
is run. The server will not start without them.

| Dependency | Minimum version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | `20.0.0` | MCP server runtime |
| npm | `9.0.0` | Package management |
| Bash | `5.0` | Dispatch and orchestration scripts |

### 12.1.2 Host-layer dependencies

These dependencies are invoked by the Bash orchestration
layer at action execution time, not by the Node.js server
at startup. The server starts without them. Actions that
invoke them will halt with a logged error if they are
absent.

> **Scope:** Host-layer dependencies are outside the npm
> package boundary. They must be installed and verified
> on the WSL2 host independently of `npm install`. See
> the pre-flight checklist below for verification
> commands.
>
> Host-layer dependency governance:
> [`docs/IATO_MCP_ARCHITECTURE.md §3`](docs/IATO_MCP_ARCHITECTURE.md#3--container-runtime-and-schema-validation)
> — Rootless Podman and XSD schema validation.

| Dependency | Minimum version | Purpose | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Podman | `4.0.0` | Rootless container operations | `podman --version` |
| xmllint | any | XSD validation fallback (subprocess) | `xmllint --version` |

**Install xmllint on WSL2/Ubuntu if not present:**

```bash
apt-get install -y libxml2-utils
```

**Install Podman on WSL2/Ubuntu if not present:**

```bash
apt-get install -y podman
```

---

### 12.2 Install and build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

`npm run build` compiles TypeScript to `dist/`. The compiled server is the
artefact Claude Code invokes — do not point Claude Code at `src/`.

Verify the build:

```bash
ls dist/server.js   # must exist before registering with Claude Code
```

---

### 12.3 Pre-flight checklist

Complete before first use. The server will start without these steps
but actions will halt at the first gate they fail.

**1. Script permissions**

```bash
chmod +x orchestrator/dispatch.sh
chmod +x orchestrator/audit_log.sh
chmod +x orchestrator/state_check.sh
chmod +x orchestrator/decommission.sh
chmod +x scripts/provision/00_preflight.sh
chmod +x scripts/provision/01_apply.sh
chmod +x scripts/provision/02_verify.sh
chmod +x scripts/container/podman_spawn.sh
chmod +x scripts/container/podman_teardown.sh
chmod +x scripts/vsphere/preflight_iac.sh
chmod +x scripts/vsphere/validate_topology.sh
```

**2. Audit directory**

```bash
mkdir -p audit/session
```

Session log files are written here per dispatch invocation.
Append-only, never committed, retained on disk for compliance evidence.

**3. SHA-256 fields in XML configs**

Every `<file>` entry in `config/environments/*.xml` requires a populated
`sha256` attribute before `state_check` or `apply` will pass preflight.
Empty hash fields cause an immediate halt — this is by design.

Generate hashes for your governed files:

```bash
sha256sum /path/to/file | awk '{print $1}'
```

Populate the value in the relevant XML config under `<file sha256="..."/>`.

**4. GPG keyring (optional but recommended)**

If your scripts carry `.sig` files, import the signing key before first use:

```bash
gpg --import /path/to/trusted-key.asc
```

`00_preflight.sh` skips GPG verification if no `.sig` file is present and
logs a notice. It does not treat a missing `.sig` as a failure — that
threshold is operator-defined.

---

### 12.4 Register with Claude Code

Add the server to Claude Code's MCP configuration.
The config file location depends on your Claude Code version —
typically `.mcp/config.json` in the project root or
`~/.config/claude-code/config.json` globally.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iato": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/server.js"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/iato-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Use an absolute path for `cwd`. Relative paths are not reliable
across Claude Code invocation contexts.

Restart Claude Code after editing the MCP config.

---

## 12.5 Verify the server is running

Start the server manually to confirm it initialises without error:

```bash
npm start
```

Expected stderr output on clean start:

```
2026-04-01T04:12:00.000Z | IATO-MCP | host=ws01 user=dhruv pid=1234 | SERVER_START | pid=1234 actions=apply,state_check,decommission,spawn_container,teardown_container,vsphere_preflight
2026-04-01T04:12:00.012Z | IATO-MCP | host=ws01 user=dhruv pid=1234 | SERVER_READY | transport=stdio
```

Two lines. If neither appears, check Node.js version and that `dist/server.js`
exists. If only the first appears, the MCP SDK transport initialisation failed —
confirm `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` installed correctly.

Stop with `Ctrl+C`. Claude Code manages the process lifecycle in normal use —
this manual start is for verification only.

---

### 12.6 Enumerated actions

Claude Code can invoke exactly these six actions via the MCP server.
No others exist. Unknown action strings halt immediately and are logged.

| Tool | Bash entry point | State change |
|---|---|---|
| `apply` | `dispatch.sh apply` | YES — provisions workspace |
| `state_check` | `dispatch.sh state_check` | NO — read and compare only |
| `decommission` | `dispatch.sh decommission` | YES — eliminates and rebuilds |
| `spawn_container` | `dispatch.sh spawn_container` | YES — starts container |
| `teardown_container` | `dispatch.sh teardown_container` | YES — removes container |
| `vsphere_preflight` | `dispatch.sh vsphere_preflight` | NO — assertions only |

Three read-only governance tools are also available:
`read_risk_committee`, `read_defense_appendix`, `read_compliance_crosswalk`.
These invoke no shell and produce no state change.

---

### 12.7 Exit codes

| Code | Meaning | Required response |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Success | Proceed |
| 1 | Operational failure | Inspect audit log, resolve before retry |
| 2 | State deviation detected | Invoke `decommission` — do not retry the failed action |

Exit 2 is a distinct signal. The audit log will contain `STATE_DEVIATION`
entries identifying which files deviated and their declared vs actual checksums.

---

### 12.8 Audit log location

Each dispatch invocation writes a session log:

```
audit/session/YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS_PID.log
```

Log entries are append-only and machine-parseable:

```
2026-04-01T04:12:33.441Z | IATO-MCP | host=ws01 user=dhruv pid=4421 | ACTION | apply script=01_apply.sh config=workstation.xml
```

These files are `.gitignored` from commit and retained on disk.
Retention schedule and off-host backup are operator responsibilities —
see operator action items in `docs/IATO_MCP_ARCHITECTURE.md §6`.

---

### 12.9 Development mode

Run without building first:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Uses `ts-node` to execute TypeScript directly. Suitable for local iteration.
Do not register `npm run dev` with Claude Code — use the compiled
`dist/server.js` for all governed use.
